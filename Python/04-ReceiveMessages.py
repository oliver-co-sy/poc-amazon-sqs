# Receive messages from the queue
#
# Requirements:
#   - URL of an existing queue
#
# Note:
#   It is important to keep in mind that receiving a message from the SQS queue doesnâ€™t automatically delete it.
#   Any other consumer can also retrieve the same message once the VisibilityTimeout period expires. To ensure, no other
#   consumer retrieves the same message, it needs to be deleted within the VisibilityTimeout time period.
